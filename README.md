# Canvas Game - "Snow Fall"
I developed this game, using Canvas.   

It's a simple game where the player girl can gain a point when she catches a star and loses a point when she gets hit by snow.  
You can move her right and left with keyboard. 
If you can get 17 points within 100 secnods, you win. 

Good luck! :)
